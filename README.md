### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aaron Chafetz and am a Senior Economist at the [U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)](https://usaid.gov/) in the [Office of HIV/AIDS](https://www.usaid.gov/global-health/health-areas/hiv-and-aids), where I specializes in quantitative analysis of global health data. Most of my work is concentrated in analyzing large quantities of data from health facilities and communities around the world, identifying indicator trends and outliers to inform data drive decision making within the interagency space of [PEPFAR, the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/). 

I works with a small team of data scientists and analysts ([@USAID-OHA-SI](https://github.com/USAID-OHA-SI)), helping to advance analytics, tools, and communication both at headquarters and the field. Working closely with @tessam30, @baboyma, @jaliasd, @karishmas26, and @n-petrovic, we've developed a [number of R packages](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/tools/) for working with PEPFAR data using R, all strongly built off the tidyverse and grounded in principles of reproducibility, transparency and accountability. We've designed a [R build blocks series](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/learn/categories/#rbbs) based on R for Data Science, but geared towards our headquarter and mission base using PEPFAR data and workflows

I'm passionate about data viz and share thoughts and inspiration with my teammates in a series called [Monday Data Viz](https://usaid-oha-si.github.io/learn/tags/#Monday%20data%20viz). @tessam and I developed a [data viz style guide](https://issuu.com/achafetz/docs/oha_styleguide) for our office that I'm pretty proud of.
